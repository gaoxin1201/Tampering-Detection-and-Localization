# Reliability Fusing Map (RFM)

This repository is implementation of "Image Tampering Detection and Localization via Reliability Fusion Map‚Äù (RFM). The main contributions are summarized as follows  (1) obtaining higher accuracy; (2) reducing computational complexity of clustering; (3) improving localization fineness from 64 x 64 to 32 x 32.

# Prerequisites

* tensorflow == 1.7.0
* pandas == 0.23.4
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.19.2
* matplotlib == 2.2.3
* Pillow == 5.2.0

<br>

# Usage

* Run pretrain model:

1. You can download pretrain model at: [Baidu disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mYEHwtQdIUb5vugruUppRA), password=`mxqr`
   [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ULTmA1Ef5Y8NcOc1bSF8Ksj7rapaN0zO/view?usp=sharing)

   put unzip folder into `code/model/{scope_name}`, see `{scope_name}` in `code.config.py`

2. Run pre-train test using command:

   > python main.py --code.config --action test

   where `code.config.py` is config file including CNN architecture, dataset name, and so on. <br>

   

   The CNN module pre-train output is a csv file, which format with: 

   `{f1,f2,f3...,predict_label,true_label,quality_factory}`, where f1,f2... is CNN confidence of each camera model.

3. Post-train in `experiment` folder

<hr><br>

* You can train your personal pretrain model:

1. Download Drensden dataset into /code/dataset

   > python main.py --code.config --action download --name Dresden

2. Generate a tensorflow `records` file:

   > python main.py --code.config --action generator

3. For training process, running command:

   > python main.py --conf code.config --action train

4. Making your personal tampering dataset:

   > python main.py --conf code.config --action splicing
